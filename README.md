# swift-serve-frontend

To save time waiting while food is being prepared, we created an app that allows users to order and reserve seats beforehand.
When the food is ready, the restaurant notifies the customer through our app, with fresh food ready at the table- time-efficient and contactless while being able to enjoy the restaurant atmosphere.
Our app also helps restaurants to digitalize, create their own layout, and manage their reservations.
bringing the brick-and-mortar experience into a software platform

Saving time while saving lives, a common goal for all of us here. We've created an app that speeds, simplifies, and savvies the abilities of small to large restaurants to manage their floor in this covid era. Contactless cuisine, hot and ready at your desired time! Check out SwiftServe today.
